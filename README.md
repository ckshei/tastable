# Tastable

Tastable is a gem that helps you find nearby restaurants, based on your zipcode and party size, that have reservations available for the same day. 

## Installation

To use the gem, first type in your zip code and party size. From there it should provide a few restaurants close by with open availability. 

Sometimes no restaurants will be provided, in which case the gem will prompt you to try another zip code. 

When you type res to make the reservation, it will return a link to the mobile reservation url of the restaurant you are interested in. From there, log into your OpenTable account and make the reservation.
